# Machine Learning Logistic Regression

This repository contains a practice exercise for implementing a logistic regression model to predict whether workers will leave based on several variables. The model utilizes the following input features: 'satisfaction_level', 'average_monthly_hours', 'promotion_last_5_years', and 'salary'. The dataset used for this exercise is a custom-made dataset provided by Codebasic for practice purposes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this practice exercise is a custom-made dataset specifically designed for training and evaluating a logistic regression model. It consists of various attributes related to employees in a company, including the variables mentioned above. The dataset is provided by Codebasic, a reliable source for practice datasets in the field of machine learning.
